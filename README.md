## Known problems and possible solutions

1. Oven overheats - *Solution:* When the appliance company (Not VIP Appliances who are great BTW) came to access the issue they advised us that we should probably avoid cooking items that produce steam. Redicoulous right! The actual solution was to replace the heat sensor responsible for triggering the ventilation in the unit.


## Pros and Cons

### Pros

* Build quality and the finishes are top end
* Beautiful canal views
* Friendly community of amazing people
* Well maintained and managed property
* Lush and well maintained lanscaping and gardens
* Convenient location within Yacht club in close proximity to great outside ameneties
* Terrific on premesis ameneties including a large community pool, theatre and gym
* Safe and secure

### Cons

* Phase II construction has not begun as yet
* Limited parking (larger problem when Phase II completed)
* Operational overhead of the Stone Island community is substantial
* Buildings 6, 7, 8 & 9 + buildings in second phase subject to loud evenings of noise from Morgans and Baccaro
* Sound proofing between unit could be better (ie. music, TV, people on stairs can be heard in adjacent units)
* Management appear to choose which by-laws they enforce
* Dimmer and LED lighting mismatch causes flickering
* Gap in staircase riser makes units unfriendly to small pets
* Shower thresholds flush with floor so water seeps out
* Water preassure in the community is between 38 - 45 PSI (meaning weak showers and poor preassure)
* Air conditioning within units known to short cycle
