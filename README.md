## Known problems and possible solutions

### Overheating oven

**Issue/Cause** Ventilation for oven not working efficiently causing sensor to trip automatic shutoff protecting oven components from overheating.

**Solution:** When the appliance company (Not VIP Appliances who are great BTW) came to access the issue they advised us that we should probably avoid cooking items that produce steam. Redicoulous right! The actual solution was to replace the heat sensor responsible for triggering the ventilation in the unit.

### Shower seeping out from shower

**Issue/Cause** The tile inside and outside the shower are at the same level without any slope. Water seeps out the shower as a result requiring cleanup each time a shower is run.

**Solution** Build small dams using either silicone or plexiglass and place them in the areas where the water is seeping out. These should be between 1.5 and 2" in lenght.

### Main Sub-Zero refrigerator handle breaks

**Issue/Cause** The fridge door is heavy and under suction preassure after the door is closed. Force is exterted on two weak areas on the design of this handle. Over time these break.

**Solution** The solution is replacing the handle when it breaks which. This is a pain as the door panel needs to come off in order to gain access to the screws holding the handle in place. It consistancy is not an issue with the other handles in your kitchen you can likely find a much better/stronger handle.

## General maintenance recommendations

1. Garage door
2. Vaccume coil on all fridges
3. Periodically run diluted viniger solution though dishwasher and washing machine
4. Flush washing machine drains
5. Pull out dryer and clean duct

### Cons

* Phase II construction has not begun as yet
* Limited parking (larger problem when Phase II completed)
* Operational overhead of the Stone Island community is substantial
* Buildings 6, 7, 8 & 9 + buildings in second phase subject to loud evenings of noise from Morgans and Baccaro
* Sound proofing between unit could be better (ie. music, TV, people on stairs can be heard in adjacent units)
* Management appear to choose which by-laws they enforce
* Dimmer and LED lighting mismatch causes flickering
* Gap in staircase riser makes units unfriendly to small pets
* Shower thresholds flush with floor so water seeps out
* Water preassure in the community is between 38 - 45 PSI (meaning weak showers and poor preassure)
* Air conditioning within units known to short cycle
