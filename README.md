### Cons

* Phase II construction has not begun as yet
* Limited parking (larger problem when Phase II completed)
* Operational overhead of the Stone Island community is substantial
* Buildings 6, 7, 8 & 9 + buildings in second phase subject to loud evenings of noise from Morgans and Baccaro
* Sound proofing between unit could be better (ie. music, TV, people on stairs can be heard in adjacent units)
* Management appear to choose which by-laws they enforce
* Dimmer and LED lighting mismatch causes flickering
* Gap in staircase riser makes units unfriendly to small pets
* Shower thresholds flush with floor so water seeps out
* Water preassure in the community is between 38 - 45 PSI (meaning weak showers and poor preassure)
* Air conditioning within units known to short cycle
